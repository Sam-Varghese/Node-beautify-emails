- Thanks a lot for your time and efforts on development of this project.
- Just create an issue for the change you would like to bring to this project.
- Then I'll assign the issue to you if you're willing to work on that.
- Then fork the repo, clone this in your local machine, and start working in a newly created branch.
- After you've made the changes, submit the PR, and I'll look into that as soon as possible.
