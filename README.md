I'll recommend you to just have a look at this video where I've explained the working of this program: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Q-p8rxGLUpJKk-gIi93d_o--G5E3fji/view?usp=sharing

- To install all necessary packages, and make required folders, do as follows:
1. Just execute the Setup.js program, and run the 1st and 2nd option.

- Now that we've installed imp packages, code the component we generated.
- Now register this component in the prototype.txt
- Now start the compiler...
- We've made a component, and are also able to view it in the browser.
- Now the final email-suitable code is there in Output.html
- Copy that code 
- Paste the code after editing the gmail component as html
- Now our mail also has the same look!
- Thanks for watching! have a great day ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
